Here I uploaded two source code:
Abaqus code:
this script can directly run in abaqus and then can build dataset as user defined the number of images and particle size and numbers
CNN_CODE:
this code can be run in jupyter notebook and user can easly based on the dataset which created in the first step train a CNN model
